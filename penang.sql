Taking place along Lorong Baru, it all starts out at 16:00 when the street comes alive with hawkers setting up along the avenue. The road closes down to traffic, and colourful plastic tables and chairs are placed out in front of individual stalls. Almost everything is good here Ã¢â‚¬â€œ if you like spicy food we suggest char kway teow (stir-fried flat rice noodles), which come with lashings of cockles, fat and juicy prawns, and bean sprouts.'),

Its decor of white linen cloth-covered tables, Victorian-era furniture, stately grand piano and soft lighting from crystal chandeliers makes for a pretty special dining experience.   This restaurant is something special from among PenangÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s array of food offerings, and the food is certainly creative. Dishes like crÃƒÂ¨me of mushroom soup, rich lobster bisque with spiced dhal emulsion and juicy baked wagyu fillet mignon are done well enough, but it is the pan-grilled cod fish that steals the show.'),
(13, 'Restoran Sup Hameed', 'restaurant8.jpg', 'If you are looking for a place that serves nasi kandar that straddles the fine line between fiery spiciness and rich taste, we recommend Restoran Sup Hameed Nasi Kandar. The restaurant serves the usual nasi kandar dishes like sotong sambal (squid in spicy gravy), mutton and fish curry, and beef and chicken gravy but it is their huge selection of vegetables that has us impressed. We love the French beans sautÃƒÂ©ed in a light soy sauce, fried egg, onions and garlic, steamed lady fingers and the curried mixed vegetables. But these are generally pretty spicy dishes; for those who canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t handle peppery food we highly recommend a plate of their steamed rice drizzled with the rich, coconut-based green-grey kurma gravy, with honey chicken and crunchy cabbage and carrots on the side');

Seasoned budget fashionistas head for Penang Times Square when searching for one-of-a-kind selections to help them stand out: though there are not that many stores open here, the ones that are in operation offer some pretty good deals, particularly when it comes to apparel and shoes.
